The tone aligns well with the 2/5 rating, expressing disappointment and frustration. | Alignment: The review expresses significant dissatisfaction with the new developer tool, citing issues with documentation, support, and updates. The comparison to a \"well-tended garden\" versus the current experience further emphasizes the negative sentiment, which aligns well with the 2/5 rating. The intensity of the criticism is appropriate for a low rating. | Expertise: The review demonstrates a strong understanding of the challenges involved in migrating developer tools within an enterprise environment. The reviewer accurately uses technical terms and highlights relevant issues such as documentation quality, support responsiveness, and update frequency. The use case of migrating a \"sizable estate\" is realistic for an enterprise admin. The review also reflects the expected concerns and priorities of an IT administrator in this context. | Uniqueness: The review demonstrates a good level of uniqueness.
